<p>I dearly cherished all the experiences and moments I have encountered in the Arts Media and Entertainment Academy. I am very grateful that I was a part of this Program in Burton High School because this one big opportunity to participate on this particular program. Not all High Schools here in San Francisco have an Arts Media Entertainment Academy. I’ve been a part of this amazing program for almost three years now. In 2013, as a sophomore to be at Burton, I chose AME as my Academy class because not just that I am a tech savvy person, but also I want to explore and understand the digital world in the new upcoming era. In the years that passed by, I have procure communication skills and team in AME. Communication skills and Teamwork is the most important virtue in AME, without it, I or any in our class wouldn’t be successful at all.
 
The AME program requires its’ students to work with different fellow students in any new projects or assignments given from the teacher. Past 2 years, we have often worked on writing scripts for the video that we are going to make produced by our Teacher: Douglas Singer (AME 1&2) and pitching the ideas to class of how would the product video will look like afterwards and to talk about what techniques in camera shots the team will use, and lastly to discuss what equipments will use and the class will respond according to what they’ve heard in the pitch and it would be a thumbs up for the rest of the class and ready to go. I consider this as one of my memorable moment that I have experienced in AME because I have achieved my goal to have a better communication skill [coordinate w/teammates].
 
Throughout the entire three years in AME, coding was most challenging assignment that I have encountered; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. JavaScript and JQuery are one of the most engaging coding and where I had hard time understanding and finishing both. I was very fascinated with coding especially when Mr. Chow brought us last year [2015] to the Dreamforce Convention in Downtown San Francisco, that there have been no software’s used to functions Code X technologies/machines [Unknown to the public], but codes. However, I have found out throughout the years I have been in AME as I innovate, that even though that I am a tech savvy person, I don’t get along with coding. It is quite absurd for me to force it, because I don’t really like coding at all. Although I have learned the basic terms in coding and how works in technology system. I am more into photography, videography, editing at software’s, writing scripts, and pitches.

Overall, as a part of this community/family, it had taught me of how to be a better communicator, leader, and follower. It has been a great time learning and innovating ourselves through this program; from all the techniques and skills I’ve learned - I will carry these for the rest of my life and as I pursue my career I will cherish every moment that I have been a part of  the Academy of Arts Media and Entertainment. </p>
